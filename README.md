# testEmployee
Create a class Employee that includes three instance variables—a first name (type String), a last name (type String) and a monthly salary (double). Provide a constructor that initializes the three instance variables. If the monthly salary is not positive, do not set its value and display an error message. Write a class TestEmployee that demonstrates the class Employee. Read the first name, last name and monthly salary of two employees from screen input, create two employee objects using the constructor, and display each employee’s last name, first name, and monthly salary using getFirstName(), getLastName() and getSalary() operations.
